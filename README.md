# Product-Unit-Autoencoders
Using Product Units in auto-encoders as apposed to summation Units.
In this project, I am training classification auto-encoders using product units. 
My research aims to investigate the number of nodes and layers of a product unit versus a summation unit autoencoder to archive a similar level of data compressionability.
